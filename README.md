HW 6 - Gif-Tastic: Using GIPHY API

This assignment is designed to call the GIPHY API using JavaScript & JQuery

*How it works*

    The page comes pre-loaded with several clickable buttons that generate 10 gifs at a time based on button subject.
    Guest may create their own buttons by entering a word in the search field and clicking 'Create Button'
    Loaded GIFs remain static until clicked. 
        -To stop play, simply click on GIF again (repeat as desired).
    Add as many buttons as desired.

    Thanks for playing with the Gif-Machine!
